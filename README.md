**Our files are organized in different folders:**

**Folder: Preregistration forms**

The folder “Preregistration forms” contains the preregistration forms submitted to the aspredicted.org platform prior to data collection.

**Folder: Materials**

The folder “Materials” contains the Qualtrics Survey exported from the Qualtrics Survey Platform using the “Print survey” function. To avoid copyright infringement, scales used in prior research have been replaced with the relevant reference.

**Folder Raw Data** 

The folder “Raw Data” contains our anonymized raw data as exported from the Qualtrics Survey Platform. It moreover contains the preparation syntaxes for the statistical software R, which were used to prepare the dataset for analyses. 
Please note that the responses to the demographic variables race, whether a person is a native speaker or not, and the open entry gender field have been deleted to protect anonymity. It finally contains our codebooks; a more detailed description of the Qualtrics surveys including the raw variable names. Please note that the raw data is not prepared for analyses. The prepared data is in the folder "Data and Analyses".

**Folder: Data and Analyses**

The folder “Data and Analyses” contains our prepared data sets that were used for our analyses. It moreover contains all analyses syntaxes for the statistical software R, that can be used to reproduce our results. Finally, it also includes the R output of our analyses as HTML documents. To reproduce our results, you can either examine these HTML documents, or you can run the analyses yourself using R. To run the analyses yourself, we recommend using the prepared data files in .rda format, combined with the analyses syntaxes in the “Analyses Syntaxes” subfolder.
